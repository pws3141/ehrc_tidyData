# Tidying EHRC Data Tables

The `tidyData` function creates simplified data tables from the standard EHRC
formatted ones. This can be output as an excel file to be read using _e.g._ Power
BI.

## EHRC Data Tables
Here, _EHRC data tables_ refer to the data available from the 'Is Britain Fairer 2018'
report (and the respective Scotland and Wales reports). This can be found on the
[EHRC
website](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/britain-fairer/britain-fairer-2018-supporting-data).

## Some notes
Currently, some of the data tables require some small editing by hand before being
used in the `tidyData` function. Over time, this requirement should reduce.

__TODO:__ include instructions for the hand-tidying stage
